![Intro to my journey]( /assets/img/me.png )

Hey there 👋 — I'm Christian Johnson, a husband, proud dad of three, and someone who's spent years in the finance industry solving problems, leading teams, and chasing performance goals. But behind the spreadsheets and strategy meetings, there's always been a spark—an obsession, really—with technology.

I built my first computer years ago, but things really took off when I started tinkering with a Raspberry Pi. That tiny board opened a massive door. I realized just how much I could build, automate, and control from a single device. One project led to another, and soon I was deep into home labs, Docker containers, and self-hosted tools.

While I’ve built a successful path in finance, I’ve become increasingly convinced that the future lies in tech—especially with AI advancing rapidly. I believe many traditional roles will evolve or disappear altogether, and I want to be prepared. Not just for myself, but for my wife and kids. That’s why I’m committing to a new journey: transitioning into information security.

## 🎯 My Plan

I’ll soon be enrolling in a certification prep class, starting with **CompTIA Network+**, and plan to work my way into an entry-level IT or InfoSec role. From there? I’ll keep leveling up—certs, college, hands-on experience, all of it.

## 💡 What This Blog Is About

This site will serve as a living journal. I’ll document:
- My home lab setups (and breakdowns 😅)
- Cool things I learn along the way
- Career planning and certification prep
- My honest wins and failures

If you’re also a beginner—or even just curious about a pivot into tech—I hope this blog helps you feel less alone. And if you’re a hiring manager? I hope this gives you a clear view of who I am, what I’m building, and why I’m all in.

Let’s see where this road takes us. 🔐💻
